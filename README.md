Dice.py will simulate the dice rolls and save the outcome in a file.

1) Run `Dice.py`. This gives plots for the outcomes from the biased dice and the distribution of number of sixes rolled by fair dice for different number of tosses and experiments. To run this program, type in: 
  `python3 Dice.py -seed <seed_number> -trial_b <number of trial of biased dice> -trial_n <number of experiment for fair dice> `
  
 

Neymann.py will be used to estimate the parameter and its confidence interval.

Neymann.py can be run from terminal. It doesn't require additional commands.
